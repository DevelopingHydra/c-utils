# c-utils

This repository was created for me to manage some C utilities that I wrote.
They may not be completly functional. For that please run the CUnit tests to find out ;)

This project was created using the NetBeans IDE. Therefore there is a lot of garbage in the files folder.
If you also want to use NetBeans you can just clone the project.
Otherwise just use the files in the c-utils-files/ directory. The CUnit tests are in the test/ folder.

#ToDo
- stack
  - unit tests
- map
  - destructuring does not work
  - test other data types as well

#Outlook
There may be more libs in the future, like a generic LinkedList, generic ArrayList
